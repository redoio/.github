A data analysis tool for the Three Strikes Project at the Stanford University School of Law that proactively and automatically identifies non-violent offendors in California's prison system who are eligible for re-sentencing. 

## Background

The Three Strikes Project is legal clinical seminar where law students represent individuals serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes under California’s Three Strikes Law. Lawyers assist district attorney’s offices throughout the state who are seeking opportunities to safely and effectively reduce California’s prison population through Prosecutor-Initiated Resentencing. 

But, given that there are over 100,000 incarcerated people in California, how do attorneys accurately identify the individuals who are eligible for resentencing? Redo.io is solving this problem through an open-source eligibility tool for attorneys to filter their case load and apply their expertise efficiently. 

## Our solution

### Summary 

A data model to determine eligibility for resentencing

What it is:
- A deterministic model with a rules-based framework established by legal experts and District Attorney offices
- Easily interpretable and explainable
- Responsive to user requests, i.e. an attorney can request changes to the eligibility criteria and see updated results
- A tool that increases the efficiency and productivity of attorneys

What it is not:
- A blackbox prediction model
- The decisionmaker for which cases are ultimately resentenced
