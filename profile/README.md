We build data science tools and open databases for criminal justice reform. We are a technology non-profit organization registered in California, US (pending 501(c)(3) status). 

Redo.io is supported by the Justice Technology Association and LexLab at UC Law San Francisco. We are one of eight startups in LexLab's 2024 justice tech startup accelarator program (https://lexlab.uclawsf.edu/2024-09-13).

Our objective is to help identify nonviolent offenders serving life sentences in California's prison system who are eligible for resentencing under criminal justice reform laws. 

### Background

The Three Strikes Project at Stanford Law is a legal clinical seminar where law students represent individuals serving life sentences for non-violent crimes under California’s Three Strikes Law. Legal experts assist district attorneys throughout the state who are seeking opportunities to safely and effectively reduce California’s prison population through Prosecutor Initiated Resentencing (PIR). 

But, given that there are over 100,000 individuals incarcerated in California's prisons, lawyers need efficient and accurate ways to identify top candidates for PIR instead of manually reviewing piles of case files. Redo.io's open-source eligibility model helps lawyers filter their caseload and apply their expertise efficiently. 

### Our solution

A rules-based and deterministic eligibility model that:<br>
(a). Embodies the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency<br>
(b). Does not exacerbate existing biases (gender, race, age, etc.) in our society<br>

Our code is open-source and available here: https://github.com/redoio/resentencing_data_initiative. 
A sample dataset on the California prison population acquired under the Public Records Act is available here: https://github.com/redoio/offenses_data.
