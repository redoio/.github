Our flagship tool is an eligibility model that programmatically identifies incarcerated individuals who are serving excessive sentences for non-violent or non-serious offenses.

### Background

The Three Strikes Project at Stanford Law is a legal clinical seminar where law students represent individuals serving life sentences for non-violent crimes under California’s Three Strikes Law. Legal experts assist district attorneys throughout the state who are seeking opportunities to safely and effectively reduce California’s prison population through Prosecutor Initiated Resentencing (PIR). But, given that there are over 100,000 individuals incarcerated in California's prisons, lawyers need efficient and accurate ways to identify top candidates for PIR instead of manually reviewing piles of case files. Redo.io's open-source eligibility model helps lawyers filter their caseload and apply their expertise efficiently. 

### Our solution

A rules-based and deterministic eligibility model that:<br>
(a). Embodies the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency<br>
(b). Does not exacerbate existing biases (gender, race, age, etc.) in our society<br>

Our code is open-source and available here: https://github.com/redoio/resentencing_data_initiative.
