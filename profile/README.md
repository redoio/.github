# Sentencing Data Initiative

A data analysis tool for the Three Strikes Project at the Stanford University School of Law that proactively and automatically identifies non-violent offenders serving life sentences in California's prison system who are eligible for re-sentencing. 

## Background

The Three Strikes Project is legal clinical seminar where law students represent individuals serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes under California’s Three Strikes Law. Lawyers assist district attorney’s offices throughout the state who are seeking opportunities to safely and effectively reduce California’s prison population through Prosecutor-Initiated Resentencing. 

But, given that there are over 100,000 incarcerated people in California, how can attorneys accurately identify the individuals who are eligible for resentencing without being bogged down with piles of paperwork to review? Redo.io is solving this problem through an open-source eligibility tool for attorneys to filter their case load and apply their expertise efficiently.
