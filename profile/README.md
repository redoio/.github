# Resentencing Data Initiative

## Goal 

Identify nonviolent offenders serving life sentences in California's prison system who are eligible for resentencing under criminal justice reform laws. 

## Background

The Three Strikes Project at the Stanford University School of Law is a legal clinical seminar where law students represent individuals serving life sentences for non-violent crimes under California’s Three Strikes Law. Legal experts assist district attorney’s offices throughout the state who are seeking opportunities to safely and effectively reduce California’s prison population through Prosecutor Initiated Resentencing (PIR). 

But, given that there are over 100,000 individuals incarcerated in California's prisons, lawyers need efficient and accurate ways to identify top candidates for PIR instead of manually reviewing piles of paperwork. Redo.io's open-source eligibility tool helps lawyers filter their caseload and apply their expertise efficiently. 

## Our solution

A rules-based and deterministic eligibility model that embodies the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency, promotes justice and does not exacerbate existing biases in our society.
