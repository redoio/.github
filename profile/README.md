# Resentencing Data Initiative

## Goal 

Our objective, in partnership with the Three Strikes Project at the Stanford University School of Law, is to identify nonviolent offenders serving life sentences in California's prison system who may be eligible for resentencing under criminal justice reform laws. 

## Background

The Three Strikes Project is legal clinical seminar where law students represent individuals serving life sentences for nonviolent crimes under California’s Three Strikes Law. Lawyers assist district attorney’s offices throughout the state who are seeking opportunities to safely and effectively reduce California’s prison population through Prosecutor Initiated Resentencing (PIR). 

But, given that there are over 100,000 people in California's prisons, lawyers need efficient and accurate ways to identify those who are eligible for PIR instead of manually reviewing piles of paperwork. Redo.io is solving this problem with an open-source eligibility tool for lawyers to filter their caseload and apply their expertise efficiently. We are currently under a contract with the Stanford School of Law to develop this application. 

## Our solution

We are designing a rules-based and deterministic eligibility model that embodies the principles of fairness, accountability and transparency. Our goal is to promote justice and not exacerbate existing biases in our society.
